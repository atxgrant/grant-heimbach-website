<p>Welcome to my corner of the internet! I'm starting this blog as a way to document something I've become increasingly curious about: how AI tools are changing the way we work, especially in product management.</p>

<h2>Why AI, Why Now?</h2>

<p>Like many people, I initially approached AI with a mix of skepticism and curiosity. But as these tools have become more sophisticated and accessible, I've realized that ignoring them isn't really an option anymore. As a product manager, I'm constantly looking for ways to work more efficiently, make better decisions, and understand user needs more deeply. AI tools seem to offer potential in all these areas, but the question is: which ones actually deliver on that promise?</p>

<p>The landscape is moving so fast that by the time someone writes a comprehensive guide, half the tools have been updated or replaced. So instead of waiting for the definitive resource, I decided to start experimenting myself and document what I learn along the way.</p>

<h2>What I'm Exploring</h2>

<p>I'm approaching this exploration with a product manager's lens, focusing on practical applications rather than the underlying technology. Some areas I'm particularly interested in:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Research and analysis</strong>: Can AI help me synthesize user feedback, analyze market trends, or identify patterns in data more quickly?</li>
    <li><strong>Content creation</strong>: From writing PRDs to creating presentation materials, where can AI actually save time without sacrificing quality?</li>
    <li><strong>Decision support</strong>: How can these tools help me think through complex product decisions or identify blind spots in my reasoning?</li>
    <li><strong>Process optimization</strong>: Are there repetitive PM tasks that AI can handle, freeing me up for more strategic work?</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm not looking to replace human judgment or creativity, but rather to augment my existing skills and workflows.</p>

<h2>What You Can Expect</h2>

<p>This won't be a place for hot takes on the future of AI or deep technical breakdowns. Instead, I plan to share honest, practical insights from actually using these tools in real product management scenarios.</p>

<p>Each post will focus on a specific tool, technique, or use case I've been testing. I'll cover what worked, what didn't, and whether it's worth incorporating into a regular workflow. Think of it as a PM's field notes on AI experimentation.</p>

<p>I'm also planning to be transparent about failures and limitations. Not every tool is going to be a game-changer, and I suspect some will create more work than they save. Those lessons are just as valuable to share.</p>

<h2>Let's Learn Together</h2>

<p>If you're also experimenting with AI in your work, I'd love to hear about your experiences. What tools have surprised you? What use cases have you found most valuable? What hasn't lived up to the hype?</p>

<p>The goal isn't to become an AI expert overnight, but rather to thoughtfully integrate these capabilities where they actually make sense. Let's figure out this new landscape together, one experiment at a time.</p>
